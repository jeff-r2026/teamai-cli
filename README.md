Make every AI coding agent work by the same harness.

Git-native management of skills, rules, and docs across Claude Code / Codex / CodeBuddy / WorkBuddy and more.

For you or your whole team.

## Quick Start

### Install

```bash
npm install -g teamai-cli
```

### Team admin / solo user

Create a shared-experience repo on your git host (GitHub or TGit), **grant write access to team members**, then have them run `teamai init --repo https://github.com/yourorg/yourrepo`.

> Solo use needs no separate repo setup: `teamai init` checks the target repo and creates it automatically if it doesn't exist.

### Team members

```bash
# User-scope init (default, resources installed under ~/)
teamai init --repo https://github.com/yourorg/yourrepo

# Project-scope init (resources installed under the project directory)
cd /path/to/my-project
teamai init --repo https://github.com/yourorg/yourrepo --scope project
```

Once initialized, every AI session automatically pulls the latest skills / rules and other Harness updates published by admins — no manual sync needed.

> **Full usage guide:** [docs/usage-guide.md](docs/usage-guide.md) ([中文版](docs/usage-guide.zh-CN.md)) — covers everything from team creation to day-to-day use.

## Harness Management & Distribution

TeamAI keeps skills, rules, docs, and hooks in a shared git repo and distributes them to every member's local AI tools through a "push → review & merge → pull" flow — with support for subscribing to other teams' Harness.

### How It Works

```
teamai push → create branch + MR → reviewer approves + merges
                                         ↓
              SessionStart hook → teamai pull → synced to local AI tools
```

Members push changes via `teamai push`, which opens a Merge Request for review. Once merged, `teamai pull` (triggered automatically on session start via the SessionStart hook) syncs the latest resources locally. Skills sync to `~/.claude/skills/`, `~/.codex/skills/`, `~/.cursor/skills/`, `~/.codebuddy/skills/`, etc.

### Team Hooks

Declare custom hooks in `hooks/hooks.yaml` and `teamai pull` delivers them to every AI tool:

```yaml
hooks:
  - id: block-secret
    description: Scan for secrets before commit
    event: PreToolUse
    matcher: Bash
    command: 'bash -lc "~/.teamai/team-scripts/scan-secret.sh" || true'
    tools: [claude, cursor]
```

```bash
teamai hooks list      # list effective hooks
teamai hooks inject    # force-reconcile into all tools
teamai hooks remove    # remove all teamai-managed hooks
```

### Cross-team Skill Subscription

Subscribe to other teams' public skill repos:

```bash
teamai source add https://github.com/other-team/teamai-public.git --name other-team
teamai source list
teamai source browse other-team    # browse available skills
teamai source remove other-team
```

Subscribed skills sync automatically on `teamai pull`.

## Knowledge Base

Beyond distributing the Harness, TeamAI organizes accumulated team experience and code structure into a searchable knowledge base that the AI recalls automatically when needed.

### Automatic Experience Sharing

When a session ends, the Stop hook scores it by **friction** — signals that the session hit something worth remembering: you interrupted or corrected the AI, denied a tool call, or the AI had to retry failing tools. A long-but-routine session (lots of tool calls, no friction) does not trigger; a session where you actually fought a problem does. If the score is high enough, the AI suggests:

```
建议运行 /teamai-share-learnings 总结本次 session 的经验并分享给团队。
```

The `/teamai-share-learnings` skill summarizes the session and pushes a learning document directly to the team repo. Each session is prompted at most once.

### Team Knowledge Recall

Let the AI automatically search accumulated team knowledge before a task. This feature is **off by default** and must be enabled explicitly — teams can set `sharing.recall.enabled: true` in `teamai.yaml` as the default, and members can override locally:

```bash
teamai recall enable     # on: deploy the teamai-recall subagent + inject guidance rules
teamai recall disable    # off: remove the subagent and rules
teamai recall status     # show effective state (team default + user override)
```

**Search runs via a subagent**: once enabled, `teamai pull` deploys the built-in `teamai-recall` subagent into each AI tool's `agents/` directory. The AI invokes it before a task — the subagent extracts keywords, runs the search, reads the matched source files, and returns a structured summary of team knowledge. Under the hood it shells out to the `teamai recall` command, which you can also run manually:

```bash
$ teamai recall "port conflict"
[1/2] MR review caught a port-conflict bug ★1 [user]
Author: member-a | Score: 18.5 | Tags: troubleshooting, networking

[2/2] Deployment configuration best practices [project]
Author: member-b | Score: 12.0 | Tags: deploy, config
```

**Coverage spans two parts:**

- **Shared search index** (`search-index.json`): four categories — learnings (session experience), docs (team docs), rules (coding rules), and skills (each `SKILL.md`) — sourced from the corresponding team-repo directories, (re)built on `teamai pull` / `teamai contribute`.
- **Codebase knowledge graph** (`teamwiki/`): produced by `teamai import`, queried live at search time.

Ranking uses BM25 + graph-boost, merges dual-scope (user + project) results tagged with origin, and implicitly upvotes matched docs so good content floats up over time.

### Codebase Knowledge Graph

`teamai import` parses source repos into a structured graph under `teamwiki/`, enabling structurally-aware retrieval:

```bash
teamai import --from-repo https://github.com/org/repo
teamai import --from-org myorg              # batch import all repos
teamai codebase --lint                      # health check
```

The graph stores components, interfaces, configs, and cross-repo import edges. `teamai recall` uses it for graph-boosted re-ranking.
